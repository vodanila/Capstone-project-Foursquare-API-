    "According to **eharmony's** research there are 40 million Americans using online dating websites and those users range from young to old.  If we consider Russian market of online dating there are only 10 million users by now , but demand for this kind of services is still growing, so the number is expected to reach 12 million users in the  next two years. The big players of the field such as Tinder and Badoo have huge user bases,which allow them to charge their users for premium accounts. At the same time small companies cannot afford this because of their poor user databases, so they have to come up with new ideas for monetization of their own businesses.\n",
